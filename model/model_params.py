    # ready for fixes over time

# the base code only provides vanilla transformer models, this is how these
# parameters apply to them. You can reuse them also for other purposes - e.g.
# n_layers will also be useful if specifying an RNN.

# these parameters will not affect loading of a pretrained model, such
# as gpt2-small. However, the lm.py code refers to some of them in inference -
# for example, to max_seq_len while sampling - so these should be kept in order
# for pretrained models too.

# n_layers:
#   Number of layers in the transformer model.
# n_heads:
#   Number of heads per layer in the transformer model.
# dim:
#   Embedding width - input and model layer embedding dimension. In case
#   the architecture is an RNN, this is the dimenstion of the hidden state.
# rnn_x_dim:
#   Relevant only for RNNs - the input embedding dimension. Default -1, in
#   which case it is equal to dim.
# dim_ff_factor:
#   How much wider each transformer layer's feedforward hidden dimension is
#   than the input embedding dimension, e.g. with dim=256 and dim_ff_factor=2,
#   the feedforward layers will have hidden dimension 512.
# max_seq_len:
#   Maximum input length the transformer can take, in number of tokens. If
#   fine tuning will only affect the fine-tuning dataset, in this case using:
#       min(max_seq_len, Mp) if max_seq_len <= 0 else Mp
#   where Mp is the max_seq_len of the pretrained model being finetuned.
# tokenizer_source_name:
#   Specifies how to prepare the tokenizer. in all cases, the optimizer is
#   adapted to some extent according to the dataset the model is created with.
#       "char":
#           Make a char-level tokenizer, using the characters in the
#           dataset.
#       "custom":
#           Make new BPE tokenizer based on the dataset, using the function
#           BpeTrainer from Huggingface. Can be slow if the dataset is large.
#           Tries to make custom_tokenizer_ntokens tokens, but may get
#           different amount.
#       "bert-base-uncased":
#           Will load the "bert-base-uncased" tokenizer from Huggingface, and
#           crop it to only the tokens which appear in the dataset (so the
#           token ids may be different)
#       "gpt2":
#           As with "bert-base-uncased", but with the gpt2 tokenizer.
# custom_tokenizer_ntokens:
#   Used when creating a custom tokenizer, as a guide for the desired tokenizer
#   vocabulary size. Does not force an exact size however.
# layer_architecture:
#   Implementation setting: how to build the transformer. Options:
#       "torch-transformer":
#           Use torch.nn.TransformerEncoderLayer for each layer of the
#           transformer. Enjoys pytorch optimised implementations and "fast
#           paths". Not customisable.
#       "custom-transformer":
#           Uses local, slightly cleaned, copy of
#           torch.nn.TransformerEncoderLayer for each layer of the transformer.
#           Optimisations gone in favour of keeping implementation in python -
#           hence customisable. The relevant files are in model/transformer/.
#       "torch-lstm", "torch-gru":
#           Use torch.nn.LSTM and torch.nn.GRU, respectively
# from_os_pretrained:
#   If not empty, load an open source pretrained model as the initial model
#   state. Except for max_seq_len, all arguments describing the model
#   architecture are overwritten to describe the pretrained model (for
#   max_seq_len, get minimum between given max_seq_len and model max_seq_len).
#   Currently only one pretrained option: "gpt2", which will get gpt2-small
#   from huggingface. Superseded by from_saved.
# from_saved:
#   If not empty, load a saved model as the initial model state. Except for
#   max_seq_len, all arguments describing the model architecture are
#   overwritten to describe the saved model (for max_seq_len, get minimum
#   between given max_seq_len and model max_seq_len). Supersedes from_saved.
#   Describes saved_model as identifier for identifier in model_explorer,
#   e.g. from_saved = "2024-01-01--00-00-00" or "2024-01-01--00-00-00---1234".
# individual_head_params:
#   Implementation setting: how to store the parameters of each head in each
#   transformer layer. Options:
#       False:
#           The parameters of all heads are stored together in one pair of big
#           weight and bias vectors. More efficient, less control. Default.
#       True:
#           The parameters of each head are stored separately. Slower (though
#           the implementation could be improved), but allows more control -
#           e.g. to freeze a specific head during training.
# pos_encoding:
#   How position is encoded for the transformer. Options:
#       "none":
#           No positional information is given (a transformer decoder can still
#           infer it however, thanks to the causal masking of the attention)
#       "learned":
#           An embedding (of size 'dim') of each input token position is added
#           to the token embeddings before they are passed to the transformer.
#           This embedding is learned alongside the other parameters of the
#           transformer.
#       "sin":
#           As with "learned", but here the embedding is predetermined.
#           Specifically, it is set to the sinusoidal positional encoding used
#           in the original transformer paper, "Attention is all you need".
